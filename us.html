We truly connected on our first unofficial date at the renaissance festival, were we were so engaged in our own conversation we kept wandering away and losing our group (Sean and Sarah again). We spent the whole day talking and couldn't wait to speak again" - Mark

                        "Ok, I remember us first meeting at a game night at Sean and Sarah's house. We were playing a game involving lying and deception called Secret Hitler. I had never played the game before, but I had played similar ones, so I understood the concept. I was one of the fascists (the bad guys the other players are trying to uncover), but I played innocent well, claiming any misstep I had was because I was new to the game. Only Mark was onto me, and I greatly enjoyed beating him. After that, he invited me to his company cabin along with other friends for a weekend full of board games, where I enjoyed playing against him again (and winning). He didn't quite pick up the hint that I liked him at that point, but when we went to the Renaissance Festival with Sean and Sarah, and spent the whole day talking, I think he figured it out" - Michelle

I remember him asking if I had a DVD player, and when I said I wasn't sure if mine still worked, he brought over a PlayStation and an X-Box with multiple cables to plug it in to make it work. Another early date was when we went to Wright and Co. in Detroit. It was a long wait so I took him to The Brakeman to kill time playing foosball. He said he "wasn't that good" but he murdered me several times in a row. He later revealed Ludo, Drew, and he had a foosball table in their apartment at college and played frequently. " - Michelle

I thought it might have been the weekend prior when we went ice skating in Campus Martius and had a nice meal out at San Morello. The whole day I was anticipating it, but it never happened. During this time, he was really insistent on going to Belle Isle, a place we went to very early on in dating, and have been back to several times since. Considering it was a freezing cold January day, and he really wanted to go to Belle Isle, I had my suspicions.  Mark ended up getting down on one knee at the eastern tip of Belle Isle, after touring the conservatory, and the island for the perfect spot. He did a great job, even though he doesn't remember it." - Michelle
