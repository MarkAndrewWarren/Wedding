              <strong>Driving</strong><Br />
              Detroit to Pigeon forge is about 8 1/2 hours (aka 1 bathroom break). It's a straigh shot down I75 for most of it. 
            </div>

            <div style="padding-top:25px; text-align:left;">
              <strong>Knoxville</strong><Br />
              We reccomend flying in to Knoxville Airport (TYS), it is the closest Airport to Pigeon Forge and is around a 1 hour drive. <Br />
              Knoxville is a medium sized airport, but depending on where you live a direct flight may not be possible.<br />  
              We will be hanging out in knoxville on thursday and would love if you joined us.

              <strong>Ashville</strong><Br />
              Ashville is another great option, the airport (AVL) is about 2 hrs away, and the town of Ashville itself is a amazing (if you were thinking of bundling in a vacation)<br />
              The drive from Asheville to Pigeon Forge is over the moutains, which is either a plush or minus depending on who your are. <br />

              <strong>Tru by Hilton</strong><Br />
              Our first recommendation for hotel is tru by Hilton, it is a relativly new hotel with great amenities. <br />
              We plan(* hopefully) to have a shuttle pick up from this location, and drop of to this location<br />
              This option is a medium price point of our reccomendation. <br />

              <strong>The Inn on the River</strong><Br />
              Our second recommendation for hotel is The Inn on the River, it has a great location (next door to rehursal dinner). <br />
              This option is the most affordable price, though it is on the main strip so traffic can be bad. <br />

              <strong>DreamMore Resort & Spa</strong><Br />
              Our final recommendation for hotel is Dollywood DreamMore Resport & Sap, this place is the nicest accomidation and has an a huge indoor pool and lots of spa services<br />
              If your willing to overlook (or excited) by the Dollywood theme this would be our recomendation for hotel.<br />
              Though this is the most expensive option for hotel it well worth it, especially if you had kids to entertain. <br />

              <strong>Cabin Rentals</strong><Br />
              If you want to stay in the Mountains we reccomend getting a cabin.<br />
              There are options from small couple cabins to 8 bedroom cabins. (and everything inbetween)<br />
              Below are some options. ** Please note that some cabin rentals have 3 night stay minimums.

              We will be getting married at the beautiful Magnolia Wedding Venue in Pigeon Forge. The property is perched on the edge of a mountain, offering breathtaking views of the smokies, but also requiring some expert driving skills to get up the steep hill. Since there is limited parking at the venue as well, we will be providing a shuttle to get you to and from the venue (more on this in the "Parking" section). 
              <br /><br />
              The ceremony will be held outside, weather permitting, on the Ceremony Patio with heaters. If it is raining or heavily snowing, the ceremony will be held in the Grand Hall, right next door. Please bring a coat, or dress appropriately for the weather.  Before the ceremony, feel free to visit the warm-up bar in the covered patio for a coffee or tea to sip on during the ceremony. 
              <br /><br />
              Cocktail Hour will be under the covered patio, about 100 feet away from the ceremony site, and will be heated as well.  This is also where the bathrooms are located. The bridal suite is in the same building as the bathrooms, attached to the covered patio.  During the reception, it will be converted into a nursing room.
              <br /><br />
              The reception will be in the Grand Hall, right next to the ceremony patio. The Grand Hall is an indoor venue  with vaulted ceilings, a chandelier, and floor-to-ceiling windows.
