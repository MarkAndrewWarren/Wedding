            <span class="page-sub-header">Where is the Wedding?</span><br />
             The Magnolia, in Pigeon Forge TN

          <div style="padding-top:25px; text-align:left;">
            <span class="page-sub-header">Why is it in Feburary?</span><br />
             Have you tried planning a wedding at the end of a pandemic???? - Basically availability and cost. Plus, Mark's favorite season is winter.

          <div style="padding-top:25px; text-align:left;">
            <span class="page-sub-header">Isn't it going to be cold?</span><br />
              Probably... temperatures range from the 30s to the 60s in February, and up in the mountains it is a bit colder, so please plan accordingly.
          </div>
          <div style="padding-top:25px; text-align:left;">
            <span class="page-sub-header">What should I wear?</span><br />
             We are looking to do a semi-formal affair, but please dress for the weather, your comfort, and your style. We aren't picky.

            <span class="page-sub-header">Who's invited to the Rehearsal Dinner?</span><br />
             If you are in Pigeon Forge Friday night, you are invited to the rehearsal dinner... So we guess it is more of a Welcome Dinner. More details will come.

          <div style="padding-top:25px; text-align:left;">
            <span class="page-sub-header">Why are you getting married in Tennessee?</span><br />
            Mark fell in love with the smoky/blue ridge mountains when his parents moved down to Asheville, North Carolina, and Michelle fell in love with them as well when they went to visit. We originally looked closer to Asheville but decided on the Magnolia after seeing the beautiful pictures, and learning about the amenities, availability, and price.

          <div style="padding-top:25px; text-align:left;">
            <span class="page-sub-header">How do I get there?</span><br />
            You can fly into Knoxville, drive to Pigeon Forge, park below the venue and a shuttle will pick you up. <br />
              <a href="travel.html#how">"They need more information than that Mark" -Michelle</a>

          <div style="padding-top:25px; text-align:left;">
            <span class="page-sub-header">What is the closest airport?</span><br />
            Knoxville is 45 min away, which we recommend. Asheville is about 2hr, Nashville/Charlotte are both about 3.5 hrs, and Atlanta is 4hrs. If you have a layover in Atlanta it's probably quicker/cheaper to drive instead.

          <div style="padding-top:25px; text-align:left;">
            <span class="page-sub-header">What are things to do there?</span><br />
            Thursday we are out in Knoxville bar hoping and getting dinner. Friday is board games, helicopter rides, and the rehearsal dinner in Pigeon Forge. Saturday is the Wedding. Sunday is Brunch in Pigeon Forge. If you want to make your own fun, we recommend hiking, skiing, or just driving through the mountains. Pigeon Forge is like a country version of Las Vegas so there are tons of things to do if you're into it go-carts, small roller coasters, stage shows, and Dollywood. Gatlinburg is like a cross between Frankemouth and an outdoor Shopping Mall. We will have more details here:

            <span class="page-sub-header">Where should I stay? Do you have a block of rooms?</span><br />
            We do not have a block of rooms. We are staying in a cabin close by to the venue (where the after-party will be). Here is some information on where we recommend you stay, but it's up to you, there are many many options.

            <span class="page-sub-header">Why do you keep talking about a Shuttle?</span><br />
            There is no parking at the Venue. Instead, there is a shuttle that will pick you from the Smoky Mountain Zipline parking lot at the bottom of the "Hill". It's a big hill and is only 1 lane...

            <span class="page-sub-header">How is the cell service/internet at the venue?</span><br />
            Cell Service and Internet are hit or miss in the mountains. There is Wifi at the venue so you will not be completely cut off. We recommend downloading any maps you may need and to not rely on your phone's data.
