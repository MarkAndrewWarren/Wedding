            <span class="page-sub-header">Why are you getting married in Tennessee?</span><br />
              I fell in love the smoky/blue ridge mountains when my parents moved down to NC. We originally looked closer to Asheville but decided on the Magnolia based on resources, avaliable and price.

          <div style="padding-top:25px; text-align:left;">
            <span class="page-sub-header">How do I get there?</span><br />
              Fligh into knoxville, drive to Pigeon Forge, Park below the venue and a shuttle will pick you up. <br />

          <div style="padding-top:25px; text-align:left;">
            <span class="page-sub-header">What is the closet airport?</span><br />
              Knoxville is 45 min away, which we recommend. <br />
              Asheville is about 2hr, Nashville/Charlotte are about 3.5 hrs, Atlanta is 4hrs. <br />
              If you have a layover in Atlanta its probably quicker/cheeper to drive instead.

          <div style="padding-top:25px; text-align:left;">
            <span class="page-sub-header">What are things to do there?</span><br />
              Thursday we are out in Knoxville bar hoping and getting dinner.<br />
              Firday is boardgames, helicoper rides and rehersal dinner in Pigeon Forge.<br/>
              Saturday is the Wedding <br />
              Sunday is Brunch in Pigeon Forge<br />
              <br />If you want make your own fun we reccommend hiking, skiing or just driving through the mountains. 
              <br />But Pigeon forge is like a red neck Las Vegas so there tons of stuff to do if your into it go carts, small rollar costers, stageshows, dollywood, etc. and Gailinburg is like across between Frankemouth and a Shopping Mall.

            <span class="page-sub-header">Where should I stay? Do you have a block of rooms?</span><br />
              We do not have a block of rooms. We are staying in a Cabin close by to the venue (where the after party will be)<br />
              Here is some information on were we recommend you stay, but it's up to you, there are many many options.

            <span class="page-sub-header">Why do you keep talking about a Shuttle?</span><br />
              There is no parking at the Venue. Instead there is a shuttle that will pick you from a Zipline parking lot at the bottom of the "Hill". <br />
              It's a big hill and is only 1 lane...

               Cell Service and Internet are hit or miss in the mountains. There is Wifi at the venue so you will not be completely cut off. <br />
